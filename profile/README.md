Docker killer. CI/CD—incl. server—on your phone.


## Deploy at any scale

 - [very] cross-platform package managers:
   - C89 base depending on each OS's crypto and network lib [libacquire](https://github.com/offscale/libacquire);
   - [rvm](https://rvm.io)/[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) style cross-platform package managers
      - [postgres-version-manager-go](https://github.com/offscale/postgres-version-manager-go) in Go
      - ["version-manager-rs" suffixed](https://github.com/orgs/offscale/repositories?q=-version-manager-rs&language=rust) Rust crates

### Competitive advantage

  - Deploy to any operating system (cross-platform: SunOS, Windows, Linux, macOS, OpenBSD);
  - Experiment with different versions of each package, including clustered variants.
  - [C89] Can be called from most any programming language and runs in all environments;
  - [planned] Build specific abstractions for multicloud, like: container-as-a-Service; ML-as-a-Service; Storage-as-a-Service; &etc.
